# Solidity_Contracts
A collection of Solidity contracts that I've built

## Allowance
This contact utilized the ownable contract from OpenZepplin to provide full control for the deploying address to the funds stored within the contract. The owner of this contract now has full access to the funds stored and can delegate all funds to other addresses.

## ItemManager
This smart contract was created to simulate a small Marketplace where items that are created are assigned an item ID and then sold if paid for.

## SharedWallet
Inherits the Allowance smart contracted and is essentially just a simple wallet I've written in solidity.
